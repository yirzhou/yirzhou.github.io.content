Hi, my name is Yiren, and I also go by Larry. I am a 4th-year computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo, although I'll be graduating soon in April 2021 :smiley:.

I consider myself a weird tech nerd: I don't play games (any more) but I know pretty much everything about the latest CPU and GPU releases; I don't own any cutting-edge tech products, but I try to keep myself updated with their unique features. More interestingly, I am drawn towards how tech has been shaping our life psychologically, which ultimately leads to my (future) research interest in **Human-computer Interaction**.

My technical passion lies in building high-performance and reliable software. In my previous internships, I was fortunate to work on data-intensive applications that served critical business missions. I am a firm believer in **using the right tools for the right problems**. That doesn't mean that I'm reluctant to try and adopt new frameworks or tools, but I will always try to convince myself before officially getting on board.

I started learning piano when I was 5, and I'm passionate about classical music. In my opinion, Mozart's sonatas bring me the [most joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWYmUZTYE78) when I'm down, Beethoven has the [most epic symphonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbGV-MVfgec), and Liszt takes the crown for having the [most glamorous Ã©tudes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H0VObXXA7U). I also grew up with western pop and country music. [folklore](https://open.spotify.com/album/1pzvBxYgT6OVwJLtHkrdQK) and [evermore](https://open.spotify.com/album/40zKHK0aGM4PITqPy5vfQh) are among the best things that happened in 2020.

I also used to make videos about video games, and here are some of them:

- [Being by Kevein Brooks - A Novel's Summary](https://youtu.be/_UZVw0Uk9Z0)
- [Importance of Synchronisation (Counter-Strike Montage)](https://youtu.be/vm8FK9tal6o)
- [ACTION-PACKED | BF1 Mini-Montage [60fps]](https://youtu.be/Mw-2eUGAzXE)

I hope you can find helpful or interesting stuff here :blush:.
