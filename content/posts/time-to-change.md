**This is just a quick statement that starting from this moment (i.e. `2021-04-06 11:30:00 PM`), I will stop complaining, whining, and expressing any negative energy.**

I have been facing tremendous challenges. Some problems are those others might refer to as "first-world" problems, but they are definitely not fun to deal with. They have sucked up a significant amount of my time and energy - I'm basically burned out at this point. However, I am cognizant of myself bringing my negative energy to others when it was not their fault at all. Perhaps I've been under too much stress for a while and I did not do a good job coping with it. Regardless, negative energy, in general, should be avoided.

Hence, I decided to post this quickie so that it's public. I apologize for my misbehaviours if they happened to hurt you.
