This is my first ever article on this site, which means that I'm just as new to it as you are :slightly_smiling_face:.

## Some history

I've had this idea of writing random stuff down for quite a while, and I've had two failed attempts in the past.

My first attempt was a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) site with a paid hosting service. It was my very first entry into content management. However, I found WordPress too much overkill for my use as there are a lot of features that I never used. Additionally, I wasn't familiar with PHP, which made customization a bit difficult. After two years, I decided to get rid of it.

That leads to my second attempt, which was a [site](https://zhouyiren.rocks) built in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). It took me just over two weeks to self-teach React and build it during self-quarantine. Firebase provides free hosting which was perfect for getting rid of my old site. I ended up liking React as a frontend framework, and it gave me a taste of frontend development. However, I'm never into frontend/UI development, and I felt that it strayed me away from content creation. I did enjoy the learning experience though.

I think I've finally found the [right tool](http://gohugo.io/) that allows me to focus on content creation while retaining the high customizability.

## Why this site exists

I believe in the power of taking notes regardless the significance of the matters. Although I consider myself a decent note-taker, I can still get sloppy at times where I will forget the lessons I've learned. Writting stuff down helps me recall the happy and sad moments or lessons more effectively.

Since this tool allows me to focus on the content aspect, I am determined to start a new page, keep it alive and update it regularly. It mainly serves as a personal space for myself, but if you happen to be close to me in real life, I hope it can convey to you what's going on with my life (I don't browse social media often). If you find the stuff here useful, it will make me even happier :smiley:.

## What to expect

I will write about topics that I'm familiar with. Most of the stuff comes from my experience, whether personally, academically or professionally. Therefore, they are heavily opinion-based and could be against yours. In general, they can be categorized into **technical** and **non-technial** content.

### Technical

You can expect stuff about tools, frameworks of, and tips on software development and productivity. I will try to not make those articles look like technical documentation :sweat_smile:.

### Non-technical

You can expect some personal thoughts, perhaps on the issues of the day, life update, and so on.

Regardless the level of technicality, I will attach relevant tags to all articles.

There we go - I just wrote the first article. I have a lot in mind that I want to share with my future self and you, and thanks for visiting my home.
